# Event Coordinator

As an event coordinator you main job is to make frequent events for the enjoyment of the PAX Astralis Crew. If you need Examples for events please look into the Examples section.
It is important that people who do not want to participate in an event have the abillity to avoid being part of it. A general rule is to avoid disrupting general gameplay to an extent.

# Guidelines
- Always make a vote if the current player base wishes for an event.

```customvote "Do you want an event?" yes no "funny answer!"```
- You can also ask for what kind of event people want.

```customvote "What kind of event?" "Hunger games" "Rimworld" "Wave defence"```

- Do not spawn things within the normal game map without a good reason.
It's best to make events on a different surface as items spawned do not influence the economy.

- Keep the events on a reasonable scale for the amount of players

- If a player complains about an event, forward either the feedback channel for if they are really mad to a member of Core Staff.


# Examples

## Hunger games
The Hunger games is a game mode where people are supposed to kill each other. They start out boxed in a circle formation without access to each other and after every player is ready they are released.
To setup the Surface for this event do the following commands.
If the surface 100 is already in use, choose a different mapID

```
mapping 100
planet 100 Caves
mapinit
```
Next spawn a wall, that surrounds the entire play area so that players can't escape.
Then spawn syndicate surplus crates around the entire play area, make sure not to go overboard.
Then when all players are ready, release them from their containment.

## Syndicate trader

This event requires a willing player to be the syndicate trader.
In this event we want to elect a player to be the syndicate trader, this player will contact other players and offer them syndicate good against for a price.
Once the syndicate trader has received some orders he can contact you to spawn them in a dead drop pod.
these are the command to spawn this.

## Wave defence

Spawn ghost roles on a planet, announce a timer when new mobs will spawn, and maybe if a boss or not.
Reward the players with loot after each wave. Also don't forget building supplies.
To setup the Surface for this event do the following commands.
If the surface 100 is already in use, choose a different mapID
```
mapping 100
planet 100 Snow
mapinit
```

## Hostile takeover

A POI has been taken over by (insert hostile power) and players are tasked with taking it back.
This event will of course ruin the POI. Only do this event when there is only 2 hour or less in the round.
Don't forget to spawn some loot. Like around 50k spesos and a couple syndicate crates.
