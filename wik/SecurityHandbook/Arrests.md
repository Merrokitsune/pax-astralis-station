# Arrest
The arrest is the last option a law enforcement officer should take.

This handbook outlines essential protocols and guidelines for law enforcement operations within our sector. It is crucial to uphold these standards to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals involved, both officers and civilians.
During an arrest, the use of lethal weapons is strictly prohibited except under specific circumstances:

- Lethal force may be used against individuals who are actively resisting arrest with lethal weapons.
- Lethal force is authorized by Central Command.

### Lethal Weapons include:
- Knifes
- Shotguns
- Pistols
- lasers
- bombs
- grenades

### Non-Lethal Weapons include:
- Disablers
- Stun batons
- Flashes
- Flashbangs
- Handcuffs
- Fists

#### Examples
- Running from security **does not** justify the use of lethal weapons.
- Punching an officer **does not** justify the use of lethal weapons.
- Evading an officer **does not** justify the use of lethal weapons.
- Using disabling devices and stun batons **does not** justify lethal force.
- Using a knife against an officer **does** warrant the use of lethal force.
- Using a gun, loaded with any type of ammunition, **does** warrant the use of lethal force.

# After arrest

Following an arrest, it is imperative that individuals receive prompt and appropriate medical treatment.
Law enforcement officers must ensure that all persons taken into custody receive necessary medical care to maintain their well-being.
# Sentencing

The Sector Commander is responsible for delivering sentences for crimes.
In the event the Sector Commander is unavailable due to a vacancy, the duty of sentencing falls to the next highest-ranking officer.
The serving of one's sentence begins with the individual being properly restrained with handcuffs.
